   abstract = {This research delves into user preferences concerning structured (the subject follows an exact script to command the robot) and unstructured (the subject commands the robot in a conversational way) robot interaction through natural spoken language. Data was gathered from 30 adult participants who completed two distinct tasks involving both structured and unstructured commands. The study examines correlations between robot errors and user perceptions, as well as how past or present failures impact participants' perception of robot utility. Three hypotheses are formulated, and the paper offers a comprehensive overview of the study's aims, methodologies, and principal findings, which were ascertained using paired t-Test and Kendall-Tau correlations. The study indicates that participants showed a preference for the unstructured task in contrast to the structured one.

@article{Zand2023,
   abstract = {Robots have the potential to assist people in daily tasks, such as cooking a meal. Communicating with the robots verbally and in an unstructured way is important, as spoken language is the main form of communication for humans. This paper proposes a novel framework that automatically generates robot actions from unstructured speech. The proposed frame-work was evaluated by collecting data from 15 participants preparing their meals while seating on a chair in a randomly disrupted environment. The system can identify and respond to a task sequence while the user may be engaged in unrelated conversations, even if the user's speech might be unstructured and grammatically incorrect. The accuracy of the proposed system is 98.6%, which is a very promising finding.},
